\title{Augment survival data by jittering event times}
\usage{
augment_surv_data(df, reps = 10, age_sd = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing survival data. Must include at least the
columns \code{age} (event or censoring time) and \code{dead} (event
indicator, where 1 indicates an event and 0 indicates censoring).}

\item{reps}{Integer. Number of replicated copies to generate for each
original observation.}

\item{age_sd}{Numeric. Standard deviation of the Gaussian noise added to
\code{age}. If \code{NULL}, a default value is chosen based on the typical
spacing of observed event times.}
}
\value{
A data frame with \code{nrow(df) * reps} rows, containing the
augmented survival data.
}
\description{
This function performs simple data augmentation for survival analysis by
replicating each subject's record multiple times and adding small Gaussian
noise (jitter) to the event time variable. The jitter scale is chosen
automatically based on the spacing of observed event times, unless supplied
by the user.
}
\details{
The event indicator and grouping variables are left unchanged. Jittered
event times are constrained to remain positive.

When \code{age_sd} is not supplied, the jitter scale is set to 10\\% of the
median spacing between distinct observed event times. If fewer than two
events are observed, a fallback value equal to 1\\% of the maximum observed
age is used.

\dontrun{
data <- data.frame(
  age = c(5, 8, 10),
  dead = c(1, 0, 1),
  group = c("A", "B", "A")
)

aug <- augment_surv_data(data, reps = 5)
nrow(aug)
